            At RefreeG, we believe that access to books, gadgets, money, and
            clothes is crucial in unlocking the potential of children and
            communities. Our Ramadan drive is dedicated to collecting and
            distributing books to those who need them most, from underfunded
            schools to community libraries in need of resources. Your
            contributions will make a tangible difference in the lives of
            children and learners around the world.

                Books are a gateway to knowledge, imagination, and opportunity.
                Many children and communities face a lack of access to
                educational materials, stunting their growth and limiting their
                potential.
